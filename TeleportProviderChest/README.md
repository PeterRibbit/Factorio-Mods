# Teleport-provider logistic chest
A mod for the game Factorio.

Adds a special chest that teleports items to entities (e.g. requester chests or player characters) within a configurable distance, whenever there are open logistic requests.

The range limit can be removed and you can configure a distance penalty for teleporting between different surfaces/worlds.
